# Really what we want is `default-target` (an unstable Cargo feature:
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#per-package-target)
# so that we can have the `xtask` package be built for the host and the
# `utp-tm4c` package built for ARM.
#
# But, it doesn't look like the feature above is headed towards stabilization
# anytime soon and we don't want to tie ourselves to nightly so we stick with
# this and stomach needing to be in the repo root to `cargo run`/`cargo flash`.
