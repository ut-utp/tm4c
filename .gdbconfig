# The .gdbconfig / .gdbinit split exists because we support two flows
# for debugging:
#   1) dropping into a debugger with `cargo run` (see the runner set in `.cargo/config`)
#   2) debugging from an IDE (i.e. VSCode)
#
# For the former flow we want to start up an openocd instance ourselve (which is what this file does).
# For the latter, we want to let the IDE manage the openocd instance.
#
# .gdbinit has the stuff that's common to both flows.
